The library system program is a program I built because I was bored. You can take out books, return books, put books on hold, notify users when their book has been due or overdue,
recommend books, and allow for admins to use as well.

I will be building this so that people can use it for their own library systems, and is open source.

I dont actually except anyone to actually download it though. It will later be put into .exe and built proper as well.
